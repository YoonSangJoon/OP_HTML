    <h2>Volvo</h2>
    Volvo Car Corporation or Volvo Personvagnar AB has started as one of the subsidiaries of steel maker SKF in 1915.
    Its automobile assembly business began in 1926. Swedish economist Gabrielsson and SKF engineer Gustaf Larson, while
    planningtheir business plan in a restaurant, caught catchphrase that they would make a lobster-like strong car after seeing
    lobsters fell on the floor and didn't break when they fell. Volvo was named after the Latin word, “volvere,” meaning
    “to roll.” “Volvere” is the infinitive form of the verb – conjugated into the 1st person, it is “volvo,” meaning “I
    roll.”. Volvo's trademark is the shoulder band and bearing mark in the middle of it, which is Volvo's identity. The first
    Automobile vehicle product of Volvo was a 1.5 ton truck, and soon Volvo began to produce cars.
    In 1935, Volvo became independent from SKF and expanded the company by acquiring transmission, aircraft and
    construction equipment companies. In 1999, Volvo sold its car parts to Ford Motor Company in the United States. The 2007-2008
    global financial crisis in the U.S. has worsened Ford's financial difficulties made it to sold its car parts to China's
    Geely Automotive Group in 2010. Currently, Volvo is a separate company that does not have a direct relationship with Volvo
    group even though it has the same nationality and brand name. Volvo Car Corporation is still headquartered in
    Sweden, although 20 years have passed since it was sold to the United States and 9 years have passed since it was sold to
    China. Recently, the manufacturing plant of Volvo S90 was moved from the Swedish Torslanda plant to the Daqing plant in
    China.
